## HuBMAP + HPA - Hacking the Human Body
### Segment multi-organ functional tissue units

### Desciption:
The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is working to create a Human Reference Atlas at the cellular level. Sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), HuBMAP and Indiana University’s Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (CNS) have partnered with institutions across the globe for this endeavor. A major partner is the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), a Swedish research program aiming to map the protein expression in human cells, tissues, and organs, funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

In this competition, you’ll identify and segment functional tissue units (FTUs) across five human organs. You'll build your model using a dataset of tissue section images, with the best submissions segmenting FTUs as accurately as possible.
